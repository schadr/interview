Coding Interview Questions
=========

The files currently contain interview questions that I conjured up or was confronted with in actual coding interview.
I tried to both provide the inital question a sample solution in python with some additional explanation and follow up questions.

If you have any question shoot me an email at adrian.schroeter@gmail.com and I'll try to include comments and answers to follow up questions. Solutions in other programming languages are also welcome.
